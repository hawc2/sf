Speculative Facebook curates a small selection of Samuel Delany's Facebook posts from the last few years, when he began taking photographs and regularly posting on Facebook images with commentary that provide a chronicle of the famous writer living in Philadelphia with his partner, Dennis, working in the late period of his writing career, presenting talks and editing unpublished work.

This website is created with prior permission by and in collaboration with Samuel R. Delany.
