writing: 'In his book COMMENTS ON THE SOCIETY OF THE SPECTACLE (1988), Guy Debord
  presents a meditation on what I would call "misinformation." He begins by calling
  it "unanswerable lies." He also associate it with "disinformation" and goes to "the
  fabulous realm of unverifiable stories, uncheckable statistics, unlikely explanations
  and untenable reasoning." It is filled with extraordinary insights: Because so many
  ecological elements--the ozone layer, a population of starfish that suddenly begin
  to tear themselves to pieces in the presence of one or another pollutant, or a plant
  that goes extinct somewhere in South America--have no attested market value, "it
  is highly dangerous to base an industrial strategy on environmental imperatives."
  Climate change deniers do have market value--which is why we will go on manufacturing
  them, all over the world. "Where disinformation is named, it does not exist. Where
  it exists, it is not named." Considering it was written when it was, it is an uncanny
  analysis of what has produced much of our present problems, in terms of isolation,
  and terrorism, and general malaise. With its 1967 prequel, THE SOCIETY OF THE SPECTACLE,
  a consideration of the defuse and concentrated forms of "spectacular power," these
  are two extraordinary performances.'
