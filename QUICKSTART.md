2. **Animations**: Adjust durations and easing functions
3. **Text**: Update intro text and descriptions
4. **Filters**: Add more filter categories in browse.md

### Advanced
1. **Add Real AI Analysis**: Replace sample themes with GPT/Claude analysis
2. **User Preferences**: Save view modes to localStorage
3. **More Visualizations**: Add charts, heatmaps, etc.
4. **Interactive Annotations**: Let users add notes
5. **Export Features**: Download filtered data as JSON/CSV

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Visit `/explore/` and click through all cards
- [ ] Try timeline filtering by decade
- [ ] Switch between browse view modes
- [ ] Click nodes in network graph
- [ ] Switch typography styles
- [ ] Scroll through scroll-story
- [ ] Explore theme cards
- [ ] Test on mobile device
- [ ] Check all menu links work
- [ ] Verify image loading

## Troubleshooting

**Q: Pages show without styling**
A: Check that Jekyll is processing .scss files and CSS is loading

**Q: Animations don't work**
A: Check browser console for JavaScript errors

**Q: Images don't load**
A: Verify paths are correct for your baseurl

**Q: Menu doesn't show new items**
A: Rebuild the site after updating _config.yml

## Next Steps

1. **Build the site** to generate HTML
2. **Test locally** to ensure everything works
3. **Customize** colors/text to your preference
4. **Deploy** to GitHub Pages or your host
5. **Share** and get feedback!

## Philosophy

Each exploration mode offers a different lens:
- **Timeline**: Historical progression
- **Browse**: User control and flexibility
- **Network**: Hidden relationships
- **Typography**: Text as art
- **Scroll**: Narrative immersion
- **Themes**: Analytical depth

Together, they transform a collection into an experience.
