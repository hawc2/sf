Speculative Facebook curates a small selection of Samuel Delany's Facebook posts from the last few years, when he began taking photographs and regularly posting on Facebook images with commentary that provide a chronicle of the famous writer living in Philadelphia with his partner, Dennis, working in the late period of his writing career, presenting talks and editing unpublished work.
